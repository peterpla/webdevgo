This project is my implementation of Jon Calhoun's ["Web Development with Go"](https://www.usegolang.com/) training course exercises. I imagine Jon has copyrighted the course material including the code published in those materials, which this code closely follows.

But [IANAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL) and you should [ask Jon](mailto:jon@calhoun.io), not me.
